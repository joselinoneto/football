# Just Football ⚽

**The 2026 tournament, nothing else.**

The simplest way to follow the 2026 international football tournament on iOS: all 48 teams, all 12 groups, and every one of the 104 matches — from the opening kickoff to the final.

No ads. No accounts. No tracking. Just football.

## Features

- Every match, grouped by day and sorted by kickoff
- Kickoff times shown in your time zone
- Live matches flagged the moment they start, with the running match clock, and final scores as soon as the whistle blows
- Live scores and goals refresh on their own while a match is in play — no need to pull
- Tap any match for its goal-by-goal timeline: scorer, minute, and penalty/own-goal markers
- Every stage clearly labelled, from the group phase to the final, with venues
- Works offline — the schedule lives on your device and refreshes when you open the app
- Localized in English and Brazilian Portuguese

## The manifesto

The main idea here is football and nothing else. No ads. No authentication. No tracking. No pink football boots. No soccer. Just football.

## Architecture

A SwiftUI + MVVM app, with all logic split into four local Swift packages under `Packages/`. The app target holds only views, view models, and glue.

```
football/            App target — Views, ViewModels, Support
Packages/
├── FootballCore     Domain models (Team, Match, Goal, Stage, ContentLocale)
├── FootballAPI      Airtable REST client
├── FootballStorage  SwiftData local cache (FootballStore model actor)
└── FootballManager  Sync & service layer tying API and storage together
```

Data flows one way: `FootballAPI` fetches public tournament data over HTTPS, `FootballManager` syncs it into `FootballStorage`, and the UI reads from the local store — which is why the app works offline.

UI strings are localized with String Catalogs (en, pt-BR); match and team names come localized from the data source, falling back to English.

## Building

Requires Xcode with the iOS 26 SDK.

1. Clone the repo and open `football.xcodeproj`.
2. The app reads its data from an Airtable base with three tables, `Teams`, `Matches`, and `Goals`. Credentials are kept out of git:

   ```sh
   cp football/Support/Secrets.swift.sample football/Support/Secrets.swift
   ```

   Then fill in your Airtable base ID and a personal access token with the read-only `data.records:read` scope.
3. Build and run. SwiftUI previews render against bundled sample data (`PreviewFootballService`) with no credentials, but the **app target** needs `Secrets.swift` to compile — it defines `AirtableConfiguration.current`, which `AppDependencies` reads.

### Continuous integration (Xcode Cloud)

`Secrets.swift` is git-ignored, so CI has to supply the credentials another way.
`ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh` regenerates it at build time from two **secret**
environment variables. Set them on the Xcode Cloud workflow (App Store Connect →
Xcode Cloud → your workflow → **Environment**), ticking **Secret** so they're
encrypted and kept out of the build logs:

| Variable | Example |
|----------|---------|
| `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID` | `appXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` |
| `AIRTABLE_TOKEN`   | `patXXXX…` (read-only `data.records:read`) |

Xcode Cloud runs `ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh` automatically after cloning, so the
credentials live only in the workflow's encrypted settings — never in the
repository or its history. The committed script contains no secrets. It also
works for other CI systems, or to seed a fresh local checkout:

```sh
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=app… AIRTABLE_TOKEN=pat… ./ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh
```

## Tests

The packages carry their own test suites:

```sh
swift test --package-path Packages/FootballAPI
swift test --package-path Packages/FootballStorage
```

## Privacy

The app collects nothing. No analytics, no tracking, no third-party SDKs — it only downloads public tournament data and caches it on the device.
